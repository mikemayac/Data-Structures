# Data-Structures
Follow-up of the course Data Structures seen in the Faculty of Science. 

The purpose of this one is: 

-Analyze the time and space complexity of elementary algorithms. 

-To understand the fundamental role of data abstraction in the development of correct and complete models to solve problems by means of the computer. 

-To know the overview of the most common data structures, their characteristics and the different ways to implement them in an object-oriented programming language. 

-Know and apply the most common search and sort algorithms. 

-To know the elementary criteria elements to elaborate correct and efficient programs according to the context.
